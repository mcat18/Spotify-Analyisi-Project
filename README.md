# Spotify-Analysis-Project
To identify the types of songs that are popular on Spotify, Random Forest and XGBoost were used. The Random Forest explained 58% of the variation in the data and had the lowest RMSE and MSE compared to the XGBoost. The variables that had the most impact on predicting popularity include explicit, instrumentalness, duration and energy. PDP plots show the relationship between those features and popularity.
